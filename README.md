## About this fork

Ozobot forked the [pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) repository to allow customized builds of the [pyodide npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pyodide).

The customization only happens in the CI configuration and in the pyodide's [package.json](./src/js/package.json) file.

- Build step was updated in [main.yml](./.github/workflows/main.yml) workflow to build the `jedi` and `scipy` packages.
- Pyodide's [package.json](./src/js/package.json) was updated to reference correctly the @ozobot namespace and fork.
- Additional step that automatically patches the pyodide's `package.json` to contain all the files that are part of the build was added. In the [upstream pyodide repo](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide), the content of the `package.json` file is hardcoded and the `files` section doesn't reflect what modules were actually built. Therefore, we needed to do adjustments in our fork, see the step *Fixup package.json files to include built packages* in the main workflow file.
- Action that builds and deploys the pyodide npm package on tag push. The tag has to be prefixed `ozobot/` for the workflow to run.

The change to pyodide upstream (`main` branch) are maintained in the `master` branch of this repo. This is the suggested flow to build updated version of `pyodide`:

1. Pull the branches and tags from upstream repo: `git fetch --tags https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide`
2. Rebase the `master` branch on the particular pyodide version to be built: `git rebase 0.24.1 master` (replace `0.24.1` with the pyodide version you want to deploy, preferably a release version)
3. Resolve conflicts during rebase (if any).
4. Force-push the `master` branch (`git push --force origin master`), the CI will build the version with the Ozobot specific patches applied.
5. If the build passes OK, tag the current version, prefix it with `ozobot/`: `git tag --annotate --sign ozobot/0.24.1`
6. Push the tag to deploy the version to [Ozobot's Github npm registry](https://github.com/ozobot/pyodide/pkgs/npm/pyodide): `git push origin ozobot/0.24.1`
7. Bump the version of the `pyodide` npm package in projects that use it: `web$ npm update --save @ozobot/pyodide`

Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly.

## What is Pyodide?

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with
[micropip](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html). Any pure
Python package with a wheel available on PyPi is supported. Many packages with C
extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide. These include many
general-purpose packages such as regex, PyYAML, lxml and scientific Python
packages including NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Pyodide comes with a robust Javascript ‚ü∫ Python foreign function interface so
that you can freely mix these two languages in your code with minimal friction.
This includes full support for error handling, async/await, and much more.

When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.

## Try Pyodide (no installation needed)

Try Pyodide in a
[REPL](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html) directly in
your browser. For further information, see the
[documentation](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/).

## Getting Started

Pyodide offers three different ways to get started depending on your needs and
technical resources. These include:

- Use a hosted distribution of Pyodide: see the [Getting
  Started](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/quickstart.html) documentation.
- Download a version of Pyodide from the [releases
  page](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/) and serve it
  with a web server.
- [Build Pyodide from source](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html)
  - Build natively with `make`: primarily for Linux users who want to
    experiment or contribute back to the project.
  - [Use a Docker image](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html#using-docker):
    recommended for Windows and macOS users and for Linux users who prefer a
    Debian-based Docker image with the dependencies already installed.

## History

Pyodide was created in 2018 by [Michael Droettboom](https://github.com/mdboom)
at Mozilla as part of the [Iodide
project](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Iodide is an experimental
web-based notebook environment for literate scientific computing and
communication.

Iodide is no longer maintained. If you want to use Pyodide in an interactive
client-side notebook, see [Pyodide notebook
environments](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/related-projects.html#notebook-environments-ides-repls).

## Contributing

Please view the [contributing
guide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/contributing.html) for tips

independent and community-driven open-source project. The decision-making
process is outlined in the [Project
governance](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/governance.html).
